          %= csrf_meta_tag %>     must be included here - but cannot in a static html
		  -> this html must be non static

		  -> this page must be controlled with a controller
		  - add game controller
		  - rename mt_invaders.html.erb
		  - add csrf tag

		  
		protect_from_forgery must be acivated





		this app must retrieve the user (instead of logging in inside the game
		-with code like this?

		<script src='js/user.js' type='text/javascript'></script>

		idea: this will ask the server for a user.js script, The server will
		create something like var user = {name:'hugo'}; this var can then be
		used by the game app.
		But: how? And: is this a good solution?


		Another approach:
		the game issues an AJAX request, which is handled by the server.
		Sounds like a much better solution.
		But: HOW?
